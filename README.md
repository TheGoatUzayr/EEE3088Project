# EEE3088F Design Project – Power Subsystem

This repository contains the development files for our **EEE3088F Design Project**, part of the third-year Electrical & Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Cape Town.

## 🔧 Project Overview

The broader project is the design and implementation of a **multi-disciplinary embedded system**—a micromouse robot capable of navigating a maze autonomously. The system integrates several subsystems, including:

- 🔋 Power  
- 📡 Sensing  
- 🧠 Processing  

Our team focused on the **power subsystem**, which serves as the electrical backbone of the micromouse.

## ⚡ Power Subsystem Objectives

- Deliver stable and sufficient power to all micromouse subsystems  
- Integrate a safe and efficient **LiPo battery charging** mechanism  
- Include **battery monitoring** to track voltage levels  
- Implement a **low-power idle mode** via a physical switch  
- Ensure seamless integration with the sensing and processing units
